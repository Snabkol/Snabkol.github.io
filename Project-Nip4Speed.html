                The moment we got the theme, we knew we wanted to do something with a cat, we iterated between making a
                driving game where you toss a cat out the window and try to make it fly as far as possible, or a cat
                delivering packages on a wobbly bike through windings streets. In the end we settled on a very simple
                game
                where you help a cat drive a car through the night, but you're not actually driving yourself; just
                enjoying
                the atmosphere and narrative. The first evening I was the only developer with previous technical
                experience,
                so I was sitting and trying to learn C# and the Unity interface and prototyping a character controller
                and
                very simple detection system for interactables. I did not get very far before we called it a night but I
                learned quite a lot of how to navigate Unity as compared to Unreal and a basic rundown on the
                component-based nature of the engine.

                The narrative of the game had to be snappy and funny, to sell the atmosphere and follow the theme of the
                jam. While we wanted a lot of show don't tell, but with the limited gametime we were worried that our
                players would not understand what was going on, so I had to cook up dialogue that was not only funny but
                also informative and telling of where the player should proceed next.

                So why is this funny gamejam game on your portfolio Calle? Well. The game got hit with massive attention
                from different youtubers, streamers and even a feature on itch.io's own Youtube channel. Following
                game's
                release on Itch we saw huge numbers of players surge in and the game ended up being a success among
                indie
                game youtubers from all across the globe!
              </p>

              </div>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Rather quickly after the game jam we saw multiple youtube videos, instagram reels and other forms of
                media
                blow up significantly. As seen both in the image above, and the one below: the game reached top 10 rated
                and sold within its month on Itch.io. We garnered quite a lot of nice comments and feedback. Learning
                how
                to talk to fans and dealing with feedback at this scale has been interesting and I am humbled to see our
                silly little cat game becoming so popular.
