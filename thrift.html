                        <li>Thrift is a stealth / heist game inspired by the likes of Dishonored, Thief & the noir genre
                            of
                            the 40’s and 50’s. Me, together with my peer Lukas Arnold set out to work together to create
                            somewhat of coherent experience with a fully playable level, solid mechanics and satisfying
                            stealth gameplay.</li>
                        <li>I was mostly responsible for the Player controller, Non-Map Mechanics & the UI
                            for the project. My general idea was to make as many of the systems detached from each other
                            so
                            that they all work in a vacuum and in tandem to allow for a smooth level design experience
                            for my
                            partner. I also put emphasis on functionality over optimization which can be seen in the
                            blueprint.

                    <p id="#Vault"><span class="image left"></span>
                    <h3 class="bold">Vault</h3>
                    <iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/s9xfc9ms/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen width="100%"
                        height="512"></iframe>
                    The system to vault over any ledge proved to be quite a hassle to set up. Having two traces to check
                    location the Player wishes to vault to, one from that position to straight above the player, and
                    finally
                    a concurrent problem which we solved by setting up three traces that act as failsafes. One at the
                    first for walls, and then for ledges of said wall. Moving through meshes and getting stuck in walls
                    was
                    one from the position above the player, to around pelvis height of the player character. This solved
                    many of the issues but some remained. We managed to squash most of these issues by making our
                    geometry double-sided which, while performance suffers slightly, the vaulting now works consistently
                    in all areas of the map we have tested.
                    </p>

                    <p><iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/q_5ab-sn/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen
                            width="100%" height="512"></iframe>
                        The other check for vaulting is the auto-crouch. I added so that the player can vault even if
                        the ceiling is low without hopping through the wall. This allowed for more open level design where you could
                        vault into slips and smaller entrances.
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="image left"></span>
                        <iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/bdrz_lnm/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen
                            width="100%" height="512"></iframe><br>
                        As for the actual vaulting itself I decided to “animate” the player with code. First giving them
                        a slight
                        backwards offset and then climbing up & forward. This gives the vaulting a smooth feeling while
                        also
                        seeming somewhat more realistic. This “animation” also has the added benefit of preventing the
                        player avatar from clipping into the wall or the ledge so it becomes a nice double win!
                    </p>

                <p id="#UI"><span class="image left"></span>
                <h3 class="bold">UI</h3>

                <div class="cssbox">
                    <a id="Thrift_Image1" href="#Thrift_Image1"><img class="cssbox_thumb" src="images/Thrift/UI.webp" />
                        <span class="cssbox_full"><img src="images/Thrift/UI.webp" /></span>
                    </a>
                    <a class="cssbox_close" href="#void"></a>
                    <a class="cssbox_next" href="#Thrift_Image2">&gt;</a>
                </div><br>

                The UI was a fun one for me. I wished to make a simplistic and minimalistic UI with the most
                important element shown clearly and without disruption.<br>
                This ended up as the final design. It is quite right-side-heavy but I find that it gets all the
                necessary
                information across without cluttering the screen. The circular bars in the middle represent
                lockpicking
                progress and stamina respectively. These fade out when they are not currently in use (ie. empty for
                lockpicking & full for stamina)
                The only persistent elements of the UI are the money counter, ammo counter & collected keys which
                should all be visible to convey what resources the player is currently carrying so that they may
                plan
                their route accordingly.
                Slightly Above (to the left) of the ammo counter is the crouch status-icon. This icon appears when
                the
                player is crouching to signal the character’s sneaky and slow behaviour.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p><span class="image left"></span>

                <div class="cssbox">
                    <a id="Thrift_Image2" href="#Thrift_Image2"><img class="cssbox_thumb" src="images/Thrift/doorUI.webp" />
                        <span class="cssbox_full"><img src="images/Thrift/doorUI.webp" /></span>
                    </a>
                    <a class="cssbox_close" href="#void"></a>
                    <a class="cssbox_prev" href="#Thrift_Image1">&lt;</a>
                </div><br>

                Another aspect was the Interact Prompts. I decided to make these into worldspace widgets that
                keep
                to the style with thick black borders. In the event of doors that require a certain key, we have
                made
                sure to color code the word with the color of the lock & the key. This is all automated and set
                up via
                the door making it easy to configure each instance. Every interactable in the game has a prompt
                and a
                key to trigger the interaction.
                </p>

                    One thing that has always been frustrating in stealth games is the lack of information which
                    makes it
                    hard to plan your sneaky ventures ahead of time. I wanted to solve this issue by introducing
                    footstep
                    prompts. Together with actual sounds being emitted, if the player is in a reasonable range from
                    the
                    footsteps they will also be able to see them to give further information regarding positions of
                    guards.
                    However, to not make the player rely solely on this mechanic we added some stationary guards
                    around the map as well that will catch an unsuspecting player off guard if they abuse the
                    footstep
                    prompts.

                Learning to utilise the construction script was a fun experience. I wanted to make as many of my
                map-actors changeable and instance editable to make it easier for Lukas to place them where he saw
                fit and customise without too much hassle. This ended up being quite an interesting thing to develop
                and I will definitely keep making construction scripts for myself and others in the future!
                </p>

                <h3 class="bold">Miscellaneous</h3>
                Other than elements of the project listed above I also fiddled with making some art in the form of a
                material that sticks to surfaces as well as two post-processing materials to make the game get a
                stylized look via thick outlines & a cel shader.<br>

                <iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/zo4i_a5b/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen width="100%"
                    height="512"></iframe><br>
                The Cel shader was made following a tutorial by UnrealCG and altering it slightly to more align to
                our desired look and feel.<br>

                <iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/0nb3pn5_/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen width="100%"
                    height="512"></iframe><br>
                Similarly, the outline Post-Process Material was made following a tutorial by Ben Cloward. Mostly
                altering the parameters & attempting to add a slight camera fall off to the outline<br>

                <iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/vt_gev-h/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen width="100%"
                    height="512"></iframe><br>
                The displacement or “sticky” material was inspired by a post by Unsweet on Artstation. This material
                was used for the platforms that the projectiles produce to give it a really sticky look.
